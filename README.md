# Wordle Solver
Script that can *theoretically* solve a game of Wordle. Uses statistical letter frequency and previous rows' colored tiles to grab words from english-words-py library.

## Running the script
When the script is run, a Firefox browser session is launched and pointed towards https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/.

The script proceeds to start the game by choosing words from an English words library. Words are prioritized based on a scoring system. The current scoring system prioritizes the frequency of letters within the word. The more frequent the letter appears in the library, the higher score it gets. The score of a word is merely the sum of the scores of its letter.

As the English words library used in this script is not exactly the same as the set of words used in Wordle, some words generated by the script may not be valid words in Wordle. When that is the case, the script deletes the word and retries.


This goes on until 6 tries have passed or if the word has been guessed.

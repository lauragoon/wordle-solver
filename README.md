# Wordle Solver
Script that can *theoretically* solve a game of Wordle. Uses statistical letter frequency and previous rows' colored tiles to grab words from english-words-py library.

A zip folder containing the geckodriver dependency & executable script can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/lauragoon/wordle-solver/releases).

## Running the script
When the script is run, a Firefox browser session is launched and pointed towards https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/.

The script proceeds to start the game by choosing words from an English words library. Words are prioritized based on a scoring system explained in [Choosing the right word](#choosing-the-right-word)

As the English words library used in this script is not exactly the same as the set of words used in Wordle, some words generated by the script may not be valid words in Wordle. When that is the case, the script deletes the word and retries.


This goes on until 6 tries have passed or if the word has been guessed.

## Choosing the right word
The current scoring system prioritizes the frequency of letters within the word. The more frequent the letter appears in the library, the higher score it gets. The score of a word is merely the sum of the scores of its letter. This strategy was chosen so even if the guessed word was wrong, we can gain more information through whether or not its letters belong in the target word. We will either eliminate many words that the "common" letters appear in, or experience a higher probability of 1+ letters to be in the target word due to how "common" the letters are.

After words are scored and ranked based on the aforementioned system, words are chosen only if they fit a specific pattern. At the start of the game, the pattern is merely 5 letters from a-z. However, as we gain more knowledge from each guess, the pattern changes accordingly.
- When a letter is found in the correct spot, subsequent guesses will always include words where that letter is in the same spot
- When a letter is found in the incorrect spot, subsequent guesses only includes words that have that letter in a different position
- When a letter is found to not be in any spot, subsequent guesses will never include that letter
